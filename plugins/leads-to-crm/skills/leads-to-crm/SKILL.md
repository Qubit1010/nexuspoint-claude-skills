  NexusPoint's outreach lead router. Pushes manually-scraped leads from the
  per-channel "Instant ... Leads" Google Sheets into the matching "NexusPoint ...
  Outreach CRM", generating a personalized Touch 1 message (OpenAI gpt-5.4-mini, with a
  Claude Haiku fallback) for each
  new lead. Handles Instagram and LinkedIn today, built to extend to Facebook and
  other channels. It only pushes rows that are genuinely new (identity-based dedup
  on the @handle / LinkedIn slug) and never re-pushes or duplicates rows already in
  the CRM, fixing the two long-standing bugs in the old lead-gen pipeline (new rows
  silently dropped, sent rows duplicated). Use this skill whenever Aleem wants to
  move scraped leads into a CRM or run the outreach sync. Trigger on: "push leads to
  CRM", "sync my instagram leads", "sync linkedin leads", "run the instagram push",
  "run the linkedin push", "push the new leads", "update the outreach CRM", "send
  the instant leads to the CRM", "run leads to crm", "dedup the CRM", "fill the blank
  DMs", "any new leads to push", "add facebook leads to the CRM". Also trigger when
  Aleem mentions the Instant Instagram/LinkedIn Leads sheet, the Instagram/LinkedIn
  Outreach CRM, or generating Touch 1 / connection messages for scraped leads.
  Do NOT trigger for requests to scrape, find, source, or enrich leads (Apify, Apollo,
  hashtag scraping, email finding) - sourcing is done manually outside this skill, which
  only moves rows already sitting in the source sheet. Also not for live DM-reply drafting,
  follow-up strategy, or benchmark questions (those are sales-playbook / marketing-advisor).
  This replaces the archived instagram-outreach, linkedin-outreach, cold-outreach
  skills and the projects/lead-gen push pipeline.

# Leads to CRM

The current NexusPoint outreach loop, end to end:

1. Aleem **manually scrapes** Instagram / LinkedIn (Instant Data Scraper) into a
   per-channel source sheet ("Instant Instagram Leads", "Instant LinkedIn Leads").
2. This skill reads that sheet, figures out which rows are **genuinely new**,
   writes a personalized **Touch 1 message** for each, and **appends them to the
   matching CRM** ("NexusPoint Instagram/LinkedIn Outreach CRM").
3. It stamps each pushed/known row **"Added"** back in the source sheet so the next
   run skips it.

One engine (`scripts/push.py`) runs every channel off a config block in
`scripts/channels.py`. Adding a channel (Facebook next) is a config + one identity
function, not new pipeline code.

## Setup (point it at your own sheets)

This skill is sheet- and key-agnostic: configure it with environment variables so it
reads *your* Google Sheets, not anyone else's. Nothing sensitive is hardcoded.

**1. Google Sheet IDs** (the long string in a sheet's URL between `/d/` and `/edit`):

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `LEADS_IG_SOURCE_SHEET_ID` | Your Instagram source ("Instant ... Leads") sheet |
| `LEADS_IG_CRM_SHEET_ID` | Your Instagram outreach CRM sheet |
| `LEADS_LI_SOURCE_SHEET_ID` | Your LinkedIn source sheet |
| `LEADS_LI_CRM_SHEET_ID` | Your LinkedIn outreach CRM sheet |

A channel whose IDs are unset is skipped with a clear "SETUP NEEDED" message, so you can
run just the channel you have configured.

**2. Google Sheets access:** the scripts read/write via the **`gws` (Google Workspace CLI)**,
authenticated to your own Google account. Install and authenticate `gws` first.

**3. Message generation (optional but recommended):** set `OPENAI_API_KEY` (primary,
`gpt-5.4-mini`) and/or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (fallback, Claude Haiku). With neither set, the
push still runs but writes blank Touch 1 messages for you to fill later (`--no-messages`).

## When to use

Trigger whenever Aleem wants scraped leads moved into a CRM or the outreach synced:
"push the instagram leads", "sync my linkedin leads", "run the push", "any new leads
to push", "dedup the CRM", "fill the blank messages". If he names a channel, use it;
if not, ask which channel (or run both).

## The two bugs this skill exists to fix

The old `projects/lead-gen` pipeline keyed dedup off the raw profile URL and
re-judged every row against ICP filters each run. That caused:

- **New rows never reaching the CRM** — newer scrapes are *post-level* (post/reel
  URLs + "X likes" instead of follower counts). The old code hard-dropped those as
  "invalid URL" / "low followers". This skill does **not** auto-filter; it trusts
  the rows Aleem curated and never silently drops (unresolvable rows are flagged
  "Needs Review" in the sheet).
- **Sent rows getting duplicated** — post URLs collapsed to a useless `.../p` key,
  so a profile already in the CRM didn't match its post URL and got re-added. This
  skill keys on a **stable identity** (Instagram `@handle`, LinkedIn `/in/<slug>`)
  computed the same way for source rows, the CRM set, and the dedup pass. And every
  run cross-checks the CRM, so it's **idempotent**: run it twice, the second run
  appends zero rows.

If you ever touch the dedup logic, keep `channel.identity()` and
`channel.crm_identity()` returning the same key for the same person. That single
invariant is what keeps the CRM clean.

## Prerequisites

- **gws CLI** (Google Workspace CLI) authenticated as hassanaleem86@gmail.com.
  `scripts/sheets.py` locates it automatically (node + run.js on Windows).
- **OPENAI_API_KEY** (primary) and/or **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** (fallback) for message
  generation. Per lead, `scripts/messages.py` tries OpenAI (`gpt-5.4-mini`) first and
  falls back to Claude (`claude-haiku-4-5`) on any failure (no key, quota, error).
  Keys are read from the environment, then the repo `.env`, then
  `projects/bid-engine/backend/.env`, then `projects/daily-news-brief/.env`. If both
  providers are unavailable (no keys, or both out of quota/credit), the push still
  runs and leaves Touch 1 blank (recoverable; see `--no-messages`).
- Python with `openai` and/or `anthropic` installed (`pip install openai anthropic`).
  A missing package just disables that provider; it never crashes the push.

## How to run

Always start with a dry run so Aleem can see the decision table before any writes:

```bash
python .claude/skills/leads-to-crm/scripts/push.py --channel instagram --dry-run
```

Then the live run:

```bash
python .claude/skills/leads-to-crm/scripts/push.py --channel instagram
python .claude/skills/leads-to-crm/scripts/push.py --channel linkedin
```

Flags:

- `--dry-run` — classify + preview only, write nothing.
- `--no-messages` — push rows with a blank Touch 1 (e.g. if the Anthropic key is
  down). Fill them later by re-running without the flag, or hand the blank rows to
  the **sales-playbook** skill to write by hand.
- `--dedup` — remove duplicate rows already in the CRM (keeps the first of each
  identity). Safe to run anytime; pair with `--dry-run` to preview.
- `--limit N` — cap new pushes; useful for a small first live test.
- `--filter-followers N` / `--exclude-geo` — opt-in ICP guards, **off by default**
  because Aleem curates the source by hand. Only add them if he asks.

## What each row becomes (the decision table)

| Source row state | Decision | CRM write | Source "Include to CRM" |
|---|---|---|---|
| status already "Added" | skip | none | unchanged |
| identity already in CRM | reconcile | none (no dupe) | "Added" |
| new identity, resolves | **push** | append + Touch 1 | "Added" |
| no resolvable identity | needs review | none | "Needs Review" |
| blank row | skip | none | unchanged |

The summary printed at the end counts each bucket. In a healthy run after the
first sync, most rows are "skipped (Added)" or "reconciled", and only the truly
new handles get pushed.

## Sheet shapes (confirmed live, 2026-06)

Source "Instant ... Leads" (tab `Raw`, status column **"Include to CRM"**):
- Instagram: `Name ("Name (@handle)") | Link | Followers | Note | Location/Designation | Include to CRM`
- LinkedIn: `Link | Name | Followers | Note | Designation | Location | Company Name | Include to CRM`

CRM "NexusPoint ... Outreach CRM" (tab `Leads`, 13 columns). The skill writes by
**header name**, not position, so a column reorder won't corrupt it:
- Instagram: `Name | Username | Company | Role | Instagram URL | Followers | Bio | Touch 1-4 | Status | Date Added`
- LinkedIn: `Name | First Name | Company | Role | LinkedIn URL | Location | Recent Post | Touch 1-4 | Status | Date Added`

Column detection is by header, with the Instant-Data-Scraper Name/Link column-flip
handled in `channels.split_url_and_name`. If a sheet's tab name ever changes, the
engine falls back to the first tab automatically.

## Adding a new channel (e.g. Facebook)

1. In `scripts/channels.py`, add a `FacebookChannel(Channel)` subclass: set the
   sheet IDs/tabs, the `source_aliases` header map, and the `message_style`.
2. Implement `parse_row`, `identity`, `crm_identity`, `crm_record` — model them on
   `InstagramChannel`. The identity function is the important part: pick the most
   stable per-profile key Facebook gives you (page slug or numeric id), normalized
   the same way for source and CRM.
3. Register it in the `CHANNELS` dict at the bottom.
4. Add `"facebook"` to the message-style map in `scripts/messages.py` if its tone
   differs from Instagram's.
5. Test with `--dry-run` before the first live push.

No changes to `push.py` are needed — that's the point of the config split.

## Message generation

Touch 1 is written by OpenAI `gpt-5.4-mini` (primary), with Claude `claude-haiku-4-5`
as a per-lead fallback if OpenAI fails, grounded in the opener archetypes in
`references/message-archetypes.md` (distilled from the sales-playbook skill, the
canonical source). Messages rotate archetypes per lead, strip em-dashes,
respect the channel length cap, and never pitch. For the full sourced playbook or
to evolve the prompts, read `.claude/skills/sales-playbook/`.
